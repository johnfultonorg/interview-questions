            <p class="paragraph tagline">A strategy for answering behavioral interview questions.</p>
            <p>The STAR method is a structured way of answering behavioral interview questions by providing a specific
              example. It helps you tell a compelling story that highlights your skills and accomplishments.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="heading-1">Situation</h3>
            <p>Begin by describing the <strong>situation</strong>. Provide context by explaining where and when the
              event took place. This sets the scene for your story.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="heading-1">Task</h3>
            <p>Next, describe the <strong>task</strong> you were responsible for. What was your role, and what were you
              trying to accomplish? This clarifies your personal involvement and objective.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="heading-1">Action</h3>
            <p>Detail the <strong>actions</strong> you took to complete the task. This is the most crucial part of your
              answer. Be specific about the steps you personally took. Use "I" statements to show your direct
              contribution (e.g., "I organized the data," "I created a new spreadsheet," "I collaborated with the
              marketing team"). Avoid talking about what the team or group did as a whole.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="heading-1">Result</h3>
            <p>Conclude by describing the <strong>result</strong> of your actions. What was the outcome? This is where
              you demonstrate the positive impact of your efforts. Quantify the result whenever possible with numbers or
              percentages to make it more impactful (e.g., "This led to a 15% increase in sales," "We completed the
              project two weeks ahead of schedule," "This improved customer satisfaction by 20%").</p>
